Welcome to LinuxTelemetry's documentation!
==========================================

Linux procfs maintains a large number of system metrics that are used for monitoring and debugging system health and performance. We have developed a number of collectd plugins to capture metrics related to memory, storage devices, and networking protocols. Continuous collection of these metrics is critical for cloud infrastructure monitoring, tuning, capacity planning, and analytics
